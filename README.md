### 📖 Description :

This website assists users who struggle recalling the lengthy mnemonic phrases or private keys for their cryptocurrency wallets. To address this issue, the site provides a method for users to generate customized mnemonic passphrase words. These customized word combinations serve as an easier alternative for users to remember. `Please refrain from using short or easily guessable words when creating your custom passphrases. For better security, construct elaborate multi-word phrases appended with random number sequences.`

### 🪂 Features :

- keccak256 hashing algorithm
- support iterations, Iteration refers to applying the hash function double based on the provided number. For instance, if the number given is 2, the process would be as follows: `hash(hash("your words"))` In other words, your words are hashed once, then the output is hashed again. So a higher count leads to greater computation worked into hashing the data.
